# Contributing to terraform-provider-centreon

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

## About Me and This Project

I'm relatively new to open source development and created this provider primarily for my work needs. While I'm learning about open source practices, I welcome anyone who wants to contribute or discuss improvements.

## How to Contribute

- Feel free to open issues for bugs, feature requests, or questions
- Pull requests are welcome, though response time may vary
- The provider doesn't implement all Centreon API specs, but feel free to request features

## Get in Touch

While I may not be highly active in development, I'm always open to discussions:
- Open an issue in this repository
- Connect with me on LinkedIn or Twitter to discuss contributions

## Important Note

Please understand that this is a work-driven project, and my involvement may be limited. However, the community is welcome to help expand the provider's capabilities based on their needs.
